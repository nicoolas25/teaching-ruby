# Setup a development environment

Depending on your level, you'll be able to get a code editor like
[Sublime Text][sublime] and [MRI][dl-ruby] by yourself. If you feel
confortable with that then you can skip this chapter.

For the others that are still there, we can use [Cloud9][cloud9], a
development environment hosted on Cloud9 servers. It is especially
easy for me to assume that you have this exact environment.

## Registering at Cloud9

The first step is to sign up for a free account on Cloud9. Of course,
no credit card is required. Once it is done, you should be able to access
your _cloud9 dashboard_ (see the picture below).

## Creating a workspace

Now, you'll need to create a _workspace_ with the following settings:

* _name_ it whatever you want, `learning-ruby` in the picture,
* choose to have a _private_ workspace, and
* start with a _blank_ workspace.

It takes a few seconds to create the workspace, once it's done, you should see it.

## Understanding what you see

I assume you are now in front of your newly created workspace. Lets see some
details about what you have here...

### The file manager panel (1)

### The editor / preview panel (2)

### The terminal panel (3)

## Installing Ruby
