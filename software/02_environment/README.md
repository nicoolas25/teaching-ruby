# Setup a development environment

Depending on your level, you'll be able to get a code editor like
[Sublime Text][sublime] and [MRI][dl-ruby] by yourself. If you feel
confortable with that then you can skip this chapter.

For the others that are still there, we can use [Cloud9][cloud9], a
development environment hosted on Cloud9 servers. It is especially
easy for me to assume that you have this exact environment.

## Registering at Cloud9

The first step is to sign up for a free account on Cloud9. Of course,
no credit card is required. Once it is done, you should be able to access
your _cloud9 dashboard_.
