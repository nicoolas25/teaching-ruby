# Software

This part will give you more perspective on software development.

## What is software?

Wikipedia's [page on software][wiki-software] is pretty good and generalistic.

> Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that
> consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the
> physical hardware from which the system is built.

What I find important here is that software **is** _computer instructions_. This
definition implies that you can _instruct_ a machine to do things. If you dig
deeper into Wikipedia's introduction, you'll see that this notion of telling the
computer what to do relies on languages...

## What is a programming language?

Still using Wikipedia, here is [a quote][wiki-proglang] to answer that question.

> A programming language [...] designed to communicate instructions to a machine,
> particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs
> to control the behavior of a machine [...].

As you can see, the software and the programming language definitions are both
about telling computers what to do. With a programming language, you express the
instructions which are the _software_.

## What can I do with a programming languages?

In this course, we'll focus on creating web applications. Think Twitter, Slack,
Carpooling websites, etc. In reality there is software, thus programming
languages, everywhere. You'll find it in your car, at your bank, even in your
child's toys.

## How do I start?

Before diving into a specific language, you need to understand a few things
about programming languages...


**Languages are abstractions**

First of all, computers understand a very _low-level_ set of instruction.
Low-level means that the language is very close to the physical part of the
computer. On the other hand, we, humans, prefers to have an _higher-level_
language, closer to us.

To illustrate this, thinks about a music partition for a given song and a
guitar tablature for this same song. They both express instructions about the
song but in different languages. The tablature is intended to be simpler and
more human-readable, it is the higher-level language here. The partition is
the low-level language, more complex and harder to read. A person that is into
music could easily disagree and correct me about this.

A programming language is an abstraction. It means that it hides from us the
complexity of the machine language, and gives us a _human-ish way_ of
expressing the same computer instructions.

**There are many languages**

_A programming language is just a tool._

A programming language abstracts the low-level machine instructions. There is
different ways of doing that same thing. Each programming language has its own
caracteristics: _paradigms_, _syntax_, _type system_, _compilation_ /
_interpretation_, etc. It is a lot of new words! Keep calm, we'll see some
definitions for each of the previous words soon.

To illustrate this, imagine all the different cars, trucks, buses, etc. All of
them serve the purpose of transportation. All of them achieve this purpose
offering different tradeoffs. A sports car will go faster than a truck but
you'll prefer the truck if you have to move out your stuff.

In this tutorial, I'll teach you the basic of driving. I'll use a classic car,
the Ruby programming language. You'll understand enough driving to be able
to teach yourself how to drive other cars, to use other programming
languages.

## But really, how do I start?

We'll start by looking at the [Ruby programming language][ruby]. You can do
a lot with Ruby and it is very popular in web development. It'll be a good
choice for the web part of this tutorial.

The firsts steps are to learn about Ruby...
