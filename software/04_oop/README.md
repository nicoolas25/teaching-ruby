# Object Oriented Programming

Let get into your first programming paradigm by focusing on OOP. Ruby is an
OOP-language and it is still the dominant paradigm today. In the chapter, we'll
explain the concepts of object oriented programming in Ruby.

## Objetcs

Lets discover objects through a few statements from the Ruby ISO
specification...

> Every value directly manipulated by a program is an object.

This one is pretty straightforward. Do you remember when you evaluated
expressions in the last chapter? Each value that IRB showed back to you
was an object!

> An object has states and a behavior.

This tells us a bit more about what objects actually are. Still it's a bit
cryptic. What are those states? What is a behavior? The following quotes
try to explain a bit more.

> An object has a set of bindings of instance variables as one of its states.

Ok, that's a lot of new words here: _bindings_, _variables_, and _instance_.
Keep them in mind and come back here at the end of the chapter to check that
you do understand that quote.

In the meantime, I can give you this analogy about that quote. If you think
of an object as some real-world-object like a car, its _instance variables_
could be for a car to have its own color, a specific number of doors,
if it's manual or automatic gears, if its open or closed, and so on. These
caracteristics are _bound_ to a specific car.

> The behavior of an object is defined by a set of methods which can be invoked on that object.

Again, more vocabulary with _methods_ and _invoked_! If we go on with the car
analogy, a car can be driven, started, opened, closed, and so on. What you can
do with a car and how you can interact with it are kind of its _methods_. And
even if you know how to drive any car, when you want to drive, you're driving
one car at a time. Driving a certain car is like _invoking_ a _method_ **on**
this car.
