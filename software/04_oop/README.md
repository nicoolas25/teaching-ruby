# Object Oriented Programming

OOP-language and it is still the dominant paradigm today. In the chapter, we'll

## Objetcs

> An object has states and a behavior. An object has a set of bindings of
> instance variables as one of its states. The behavior of an object is
> defined by a set of methods which can be invoked on that object.
>
> Every value directly manipulated by a program is an object.

## Variables

## Methods

## Classes
