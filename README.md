# My own shot at teaching web development

This repository gather observations and reflexions about teaching web development to
newcommers in the software development industry. It may not be good and this topic
has been covered by more experienced people than me. Nevertheless I choose to give
it a shot anyway.

If you read this and know something that I should read, please say _"hi!"_ and send
it to me.

## Introduction

Motivations vary between students. I'm focusing on a subset of people who may want
to start a career in this industry. I assume those people are motivated enough to
follow a track of exercises, research given topics, etc.

Learning new skills is hard. Development is a world with new tools, new practices
and a very wide landscape. Sofware is, in my opinion, one of the most complex
human-manufactured thing. Don't expect to pick it up in a few days, expect a few
years.

Is it that bad? I think it is... Why should you keep pursuing it? It's worth it.
Have a look at [this article][why-software] to have some perspective on the
benefits of working in this industry.

## About the track

Learning web development is at least two differents things. Learning what the web
is and how it works and to write software. If you miss one, you'll struggle with
the other.

Like most bootcamps, I think starting by learning about the making of software is
a natural first step. The web can be explained before programming but it'll be more
fun if you have programming skills before.

Thus, the track is composed of two different parts:

1. Learn what software development is.
2. Learn what the web is and how you can write software for it.
